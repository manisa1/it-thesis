I.	INTRODUCTION

People spend a lot of time using different online services and platforms in today's digital world. Recommender systems (RS) are now a big part of everyday life. They help users decide what to watch on Netflix and suggest what to buy on Amazon. It can even assist in health-related decisions. These systems make decision-making easier by sorting data. It removes unhelpful information from large amounts of data to save time. Furthermore, it can also provide personal recommendations based on each person's preferences and needs. According to Hu et al. (2024), recommender systems (RS) are important because it improves user experiences by showing the most relevant and useful products based on each user's behaviour and interests.

As RS become a bigger part of today's daily life, it is more important to ensure that they are strong, accurate, and reliable. Robustness is the system's feature to provide accurate and correct suggestion even though data is noisy and ensuring high-quality results (Ma et al. 2023). Recommender systems are crucial for user trust, satisfaction, and financial losses (Zhang et al. 2023). Over time, they have evolved from content-based methods and collaborative filtering to advanced hybrid frameworks and graph neural network-based models, improving accuracy, personalization, and scalability.

However, as models have become more advanced and complex, it has also become vulnerable and less stable. Even small data errors or malicious changes can seriously make an impact on the performance. Zugner et al. (2020) highlighted that advanced recommender system models can easily be affected by small amounts of noise or intentional attacks, showing the need for more reliable and robust solutions.

In order to address these vulnerabilities, CL has recently surfaced as a viable strategy for enhancing the resilience of recommender system. By separating meaningful signals from misleading ones, CL helps models learn better representations and become less susceptible to data noise and inconsistencies. It compares and aligns similar data points while separating dissimilar ones using self-supervised techniques, resulting in more stable and broadly applicable embeddings.

The literature review examines the robustness of recommender systems through a comprehensive comparative analysis of seven state-of-the-art models spanning 2019-2025. It systematically examines graph-based methods (NGCF, LightGCN), contrastive learning approaches (SGL, SimGCL, DCCF), and modern robust optimization techniques (Exposure-aware DRO, PDIF) to determine which approaches provide the best performance-robustness trade-offs under realistic noise conditions.

This research offers a more thorough understanding of the state of robust recommender systems today by critically examining the advantages and disadvantages of these strategies. While individual models show promise in addressing robustness challenges, there lacks a systematic comparison of how different approaches perform under realistic dynamic noise conditions. This review critically evaluates seven state-of-the-art models, compares their robustness characteristics, and identifies the research gap that motivates our comprehensive comparative study.

Aim of the Research
The aim of this project is to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of recommendation system robustness under dynamic exposure bias conditions. This study systematically evaluates seven state-of-the-art recommendation models spanning 2019-2025 (NGCF, LightGCN, SGL, SimGCL, DCCF, Exposure-aware DRO, PDIF) under four realistic noise patterns (static, dynamic, burst, shift) that simulate real-world scenarios. The research addresses the critical gap in comparative robustness studies and provides evidence-based guidelines for model selection in noisy environments. Through 42 comprehensive experiments, this study aims to discover which models demonstrate the best performance-robustness trade-offs and identify counter-intuitive behaviors under different noise conditions.

II.	LITERATURE REVIEW

Introduction of Literature Review

In today's digital landscape, individuals tend to spend a significant portion of their time engaging with online services, where recommender systems (RS) play a pivotal role in helping users navigate through the overwhelming content. Whether it is for clinical decision-making in healthcare, Netflix streaming, or Amazon product recommendations, RS have become integral across industries. According to Hu, Li, Cui, and Yi (2024), RS assist users by filtering out irrelevant information and identifying the most relevant and useful aspects of a product or service.

However, as RS becomes more embedded in everyday decision-making, their reliability becomes paramount. One critical measure of such performance is known as robustness, which refers to the degree to which a system can perform consistently when the data it is trained or tested on is exposed to noise, bias, or even adversarial attacks. To reinforce this, Ma et al. (2023) describe robustness as the capacity to withstand perturbations and still deliver accurate recommendations. Without it, RS are vulnerable to performance degradation, which can result in poor suggestions, dissatisfied users, and potential business losses (Zhang et al. 2023).

Understanding the importance of robustness requires examining the evolution of RS. Two foundational approaches in early RS development were collaborative filtering and content-based methods (Shvarts et al. 2017, as cited in Sinha & Dhanalakshmi, 2019). These were relatively simple but limited in scope. Advances in deep learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) have pushed the boundaries of accuracy and personalization (Hu et al. 2023). However, as Zugner et al. (2020) highlight, these models are also more fragile and can be easily thrown off by even minor changes in data or focused attacks. To address these vulnerabilities, contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a promising approach for building robust representations by teaching models to better distinguish between meaningful and misleading signals.

This research focuses on robustness in RS through a comprehensive comparative analysis of seven state-of-the-art models spanning 2019-2025. It systematically examines graph-based methods (NGCF, LightGCN), contrastive learning approaches (SGL, SimGCL, DCCF), and modern robust optimization techniques (Exposure-aware DRO, PDIF) to determine which approaches provide the best performance-robustness trade-offs under realistic noise conditions. Topics such as deployment pipelines, interpretability, and robustness in non-RS domains, such as computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) are excluded from scope.

While individual models show promise in addressing robustness challenges, there lacks a systematic comparison of how different approaches perform under realistic dynamic noise conditions. This review critically evaluates seven state-of-the-art models, compares their robustness characteristics, and identifies the research gap that motivates our comprehensive comparative study.

To guide the discussion, the review is organized into seven thematic sections: (1) RS background, (2) robustness challenges, (3) graph neural network foundations (NGCF, LightGCN), (4) contrastive learning approaches (SGL, SimGCL, DCCF), (5) modern robust optimization methods (Exposure-aware DRO, PDIF), (6) comparative analysis gaps, and (7) the research direction for systematic evaluation.

Body of Literature Review

2.1	Recommender System Background

Over time, recommender systems have undergone substantial transformation, moving from simple heuristic-based techniques to complex neural architectures. This section explores that progression in greater depth, emphasizing the changes made in key approaches and the motivations behind them. Beginning with early collaborative filtering techniques and advancing toward graph-based models, the research highlights how each stage has contributed to capturing increasingly complex and multiform user-item relationships.

One of the earliest and most widely adopted approaches is collaborative filtering (CF), particularly in e-commerce platforms. According to Hamidi and Moradi (2024), CF contributes to users' ability to make better decisions while simultaneously increasing sales for companies. It operates by analyzing user-item interactions, usually ratings, to identify patterns of similarity. It builds user-user or item-item similarity matrices and uses neighborhood-based algorithms to generate recommendations (Bag et al. 2019).

Two prominent CF techniques are k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and matrix factorization (MF). kNN identifies clusters of similar users based on shared ratings and predicts preferences using the average ratings of top-k neighbors. In contrast, MF reduces the user-item matrix into latent factors, allowing it to capture hidden relationships and provide predictions that can be used on a larger scale. By integrating implicit feedback and temporal dynamics, MF has often outperformed kNN, which is reinforced by a study by Dong et al. (2022). However, even with all its advantages, CF still has drawbacks, including cold-start issues and sparsity, particularly in environments with limited user-item interactions.

To address these gaps, content-based filtering (CB) was introduced. It matches items to user preferences by making recommendations based on attributes such as genre, keywords, or descriptions (Maulana & Setiawan 2024). Despite its strengths, both CF and CB do have their limitations, which have led to the development of hybrid systems. These models integrate CF and CB to improve accuracy and coverage. Kumar and Bhasker (2020) describe hybrid RS as using embeddings to represent users and items, facilitating the learning of non-linear latent factors. Hybrid systems also help mitigate cold-start problems by incorporating side information into deep neural networks and are widely used on platforms like Amazon and Netflix.

More recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have redefined RS by modeling them as bipartite graphs, allowing for deeper relational learning through message passing (Wang et al. 2019). These models were able to take into account multi-hop connections and have led to influential architectures like NGCF and LightGCN, offering enhanced personalization and scalability.

While accuracy has always been an essential priority, robustness has emerged as a critical concern. As per Ma et al. (2023), robust RS must remain stable under noisy or adversarial conditions, for a deeper exploration of resilience in the next section.

2.2	Robustness Challenges

Recommender systems (RS) suggest products, content, and services based on what users like, but their accuracy decreases when the data is incomplete, incorrect, or changed (Ray & Mahanti, 2010). Robustness means the system can still give accurate and reliable suggestions even when the data is noisy or imperfect. A robust system can handle missing data, user changes, mistakes, or fake ratings and still give good and trustworthy recommendations (Zhang, 2023). Researchers work to improve the robustness of recommender systems to make them more accurate and reliable. This helps RS maintain good performance even when the data is noisy, incomplete, or manipulated.

According to Guarrasi et al (2024), a robust RS can provide unbiased and right choices with missing data, biased patterns, or deliberate manipulation issues. If user behavior changes or the environment is different, the system should still work well and give correct results. Researchers have suggested different ways to solve these problems to make systems stronger. For natural noise, they use methods like finding errors, filtering bad data, and fixing wrong predictions.

In response to adversarial attacks, approaches like adversarial training, regularization, and graph-based anomaly detection are utilized to recognize fake profiles and manipulative patterns. Fairness-aware recommender systems change ranking algorithms to reduce bias. They also adjust loss functions to make recommendations more balanced. Additionally, they re-rank results to provide fair exposure and more diverse suggestions. Most existing solutions focus on solving one robustness problem at a time. New techniques like contrastive learning and robust representation aim to handle multiple issues together. However, making systems both strong and scalable is still hard. Many methods need a lot of computing power, so they are not good for large or real-time systems. Moreover, when user behavior and data patterns change, fixed solutions often stop working well. Achieving truly robust, flexible, and efficient recommender systems remains an open research challenge.

2.3	Graph Neural Network Foundations for Collaborative Filtering

Graph Neural Networks have revolutionized recommendation systems by modeling user-item interactions as bipartite graphs, enabling the capture of high-order collaborative signals through message passing mechanisms.

2.3.1 Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF)
Wang et al. (2019) introduced NGCF as a pioneering approach that explicitly models high-order connectivity in user-item interaction graphs. NGCF propagates embeddings through multiple layers, allowing users and items to receive collaborative signals from their multi-hop neighbors. This approach addresses the limitation of traditional collaborative filtering methods that only consider direct interactions, enabling the model to capture complex user preferences and item characteristics through graph convolution operations. The model's ability to leverage high-order relationships makes it particularly effective in sparse data scenarios where direct user-item interactions are limited.

2.3.2 LightGCN  
He et al. (2020) proposed LightGCN as a simplified yet highly effective graph convolution approach for collaborative filtering. By removing feature transformation and nonlinear activation functions, LightGCN focuses purely on neighborhood aggregation, making it computationally efficient while maintaining strong performance. The model's simplicity contributes to its stability and robustness, as demonstrated by its consistent performance across various datasets and conditions. LightGCN's design philosophy of "less is more" has proven particularly valuable in creating models that are both effective and resilient to noise.

2.4	Contrastive Learning for RS

In scenarios where labelled data is sparse or unavailable, Contrastive Learning (CL) has emerged as a promising self-supervised approach for improving robustness in recommender systems (RS). Researchers aim to enhance robustness so that RS can maintain performance even under noisy, incomplete, or manipulated data conditions.

At its core, contrastive learning trains models by comparing pairs of data. Positive pairs refer to similar inputs, such as different views of the same user or item. In contrast, negative pairs represent dissimilar inputs, typically drawn from different anchor points or distinct user-item subgraphs. The model is able to learn stable and generalizable representations by aligning positive pairs and separating negative ones in the latent space (Wang & Isola 2020).

Graph contrastive learning, in particular, has shown strong performance without relying on labels. As Liu et al. (2025) explained, this learning is considered as a common self-supervised paradigm that contrasts augmented views of user-item graphs to improve embedding quality. This is accomplished by creating negative pairs from different anchors and positive pairs from the same anchor graph. By minimizing the distance between similar data points, this alignment enhances representation consistency.

2.4.1 Self-Supervised Graph Learning (SGL)
Zhang et al. (2023) developed SGL as a comprehensive approach that utilizes graph augmentations such as node dropping, edge masking, and random walk sampling to create contrastive views. SGL addresses the data sparsity problem in recommendation systems by generating multiple views of the user-item interaction graph and learning representations that are consistent across these views. The model's use of structural perturbations helps it generalize better in sparse environments by reducing sensitivity to noise and improving the robustness of learned embeddings.

2.4.2 Simple Graph Contrastive Learning (SimGCL)
Building on augmentation strategies, SimGCL simplifies the contrastive learning process by injecting random noise directly into the embedding space during training, which allows the avoidance of complex structural augmentations. Yu et al. (2022) designed SimGCL to be computationally efficient while maintaining the benefits of contrastive learning. Although this increases its efficiency, the simplified approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in creating robust representations that are resistant to various forms of noise.

2.4.3 Disentangled Contrastive Collaborative Filtering (DCCF)
Ren et al. (2023) introduced DCCF to address two essential challenges in contrastive learning-based recommender systems: augmentation noise and entangled intent representations. DCCF integrates disentanglement learning with adaptive contrastive augmentation through three key innovations: intent prototype mechanisms for capturing diverse user motivations, adaptive augmentation through learnable masks, and cross-view contrastive learning for consistency across disentangled views. While DCCF shows improvements over traditional contrastive methods, it introduces computational complexity and assumes static noise patterns, limiting its applicability in dynamic environments.

2.5	Advanced Robustness Techniques (2024-2025)

Recent advances in robust optimization have introduced sophisticated approaches to handling exposure bias and personalized noise filtering in recommendation systems.

2.5.1 Exposure-aware Distributionally Robust Optimization
Yang et al. (2024) developed an exposure-aware approach that applies distributionally robust optimization principles to handle exposure bias in recommendation systems. This method addresses the fundamental challenge that popular items receive disproportionate exposure, leading to biased user interactions. By implementing robust optimization techniques that minimize worst-case performance over uncertainty sets, this approach provides strong theoretical guarantees for robustness while maintaining computational efficiency through practical approximations. The method's focus on exposure bias makes it particularly relevant for real-world deployment scenarios.

2.5.2 Personalized Denoising Implicit Feedback (PDIF)
Zhang et al. (2025) introduced PDIF as a personalized approach to noise filtering that recognizes that different users exhibit varying susceptibility to noise. Rather than applying global denoising strategies, PDIF analyzes individual user interaction patterns to identify and filter noise at the user level. This personalized approach acknowledges that noise patterns are not uniform across users, leading to more effective denoising and improved recommendation quality. The method's user-centric design represents a significant advancement in handling heterogeneous noise patterns.

2.6	Research Gap: Need for Comprehensive Comparative Analysis

While the literature presents numerous robust recommendation approaches, each with demonstrated effectiveness in specific scenarios, a critical gap exists in systematic comparative evaluation. Practitioners and researchers lack comprehensive guidance on which models perform best under different noise conditions, making it difficult to select appropriate approaches for specific deployment scenarios.

This gap is particularly pronounced when considering dynamic noise patterns that evolve over time, simulating realistic conditions such as seasonal campaigns, viral content effects, or algorithm changes. Most existing evaluations focus on individual model improvements rather than systematic comparison across multiple approaches under controlled conditions.

The absence of comprehensive comparative studies limits our understanding of the relative strengths and weaknesses of different robustness strategies, hindering evidence-based model selection for real-world deployments. This limitation motivates the need for systematic comparative analysis that can provide practitioners with clear guidelines for model selection based on expected noise conditions and performance requirements.

The research takes a comprehensive comparative experimental approach to systematically evaluate the robustness of seven state-of-the-art recommendation models under dynamic exposure bias conditions. The study is motivated by the critical gap in comparative robustness studies - while numerous robust recommendation models have been proposed spanning 2019-2025, there lacks a systematic comparison of their effectiveness under realistic noise conditions that simulate real-world scenarios such as seasonal campaigns, viral content effects, and algorithm changes. This study addresses this gap through a comprehensive 42-experiment framework (7 models × 6 conditions) spanning the complete 2019-2025 timeline of recommendation research.

The methods and frameworks applied are:
•	Comprehensive comparative framework evaluating seven state-of-the-art models spanning 2019-2025:
  - Graph Neural Networks: NGCF (2019), LightGCN (2020)
  - Contrastive Learning: SGL (2021), SimGCL (2022), DCCF (2023)
  - Robust Optimization: Exposure-aware DRO (2024), PDIF (2025)
•	Systematic experimental design conducting 42 experiments (7 models × 6 conditions) for comprehensive robustness comparison
•	Dynamic noise injection techniques simulating four realistic patterns: static, dynamic, burst, and shift exposure bias
•	Controlled experimental conditions ensuring fair comparison across all models using identical datasets, metrics, and noise simulation frameworks

The research problem questions are framed as follows:
•	RQ1: How do seven state-of-the-art recommendation models (2019-2025) compare in terms of baseline performance under clean conditions?
•	RQ2: Which models demonstrate the best robustness across different dynamic noise patterns (static, dynamic, burst, shift)?
•	RQ3: What counter-intuitive behaviors and pattern-specific insights emerge from comprehensive robustness analysis?
•	RQ4: What evidence-based guidelines can be provided for model selection in noisy environments?

The study assumes:
•	Noise in user interaction logs can be simulated through random flips, additions, or removals of interactions (Toledo et al. 2015).
•	Validation and test data remain clean to ensure unbiased evaluation.
•	Findings on benchmark datasets (Gowalla, Amazon-Book, optionally MovieLens) are representative of broader recommender system behavior (He et al. 2020; Harper & Konstan 2015).
•	Findings from systematic comparison of 7 models provide representative insights into the robustness landscape of modern recommendation approaches
•	Performance differences observed across models reflect inherent architectural strengths rather than implementation variations
•	Dynamic noise patterns (ramp, burst, shift) accurately simulate real-world exposure bias scenarios encountered in production systems

Limitations of scope:
This comparative study focuses on natural noise patterns and does not attempt to address adversarial attacks, computational scalability optimization for individual models, deployment pipelines, or model explainability. The study evaluates models using synthetic datasets and established benchmark conditions. While the comparative framework is comprehensive within its scope, extending to additional models or noise patterns would require proportional experimental expansion. These are acknowledged as important directions but outside the scope of this work.
