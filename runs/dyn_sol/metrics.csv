Experiment Information,Values and Explanations
Dynamic Solution Experiment,
DCCF model with dynamic noise and our solution applied,
Tests if our solution helps under dynamic noise conditions,
Better than dynamic baseline (proves solution works),
,
RESULTS:,
Recall@20 Performance,17.6% (0.176402)
NDCG@20 Quality Score,5.86% (0.058560)
Performance Level,Fair
What This Means,Solution proof: 17.6% shows our solution helps under dynamic noise
