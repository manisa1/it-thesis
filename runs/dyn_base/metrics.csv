Experiment Information,Values and Explanations
Dynamic Baseline Experiment,
DCCF model with dynamic noise and no solution,
Shows how much dynamic noise hurts DCCF performance,
Lower performance than static (proves the problem exists),
,
RESULTS:,
Recall@20 Performance,17.3% (0.173398)
NDCG@20 Quality Score,5.86% (0.058604)
Performance Level,Fair
What This Means,Problem evidence: 17.3% shows DCCF struggles with dynamic noise
