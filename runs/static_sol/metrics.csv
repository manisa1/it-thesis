Experiment Information,Values and Explanations
Static Solution Experiment,
DCCF model with no noise but with our solution applied,
Tests if our solution causes any harm under ideal conditions,
Should be similar to baseline (proving no harm done),
,
RESULTS:,
Recall@20 Performance,20.1% (0.201435)
NDCG@20 Quality Score,6.91% (0.069106)
Performance Level,Excellent
What This Means,Control test: 20.1% proves our solution doesn't harm ideal performance
