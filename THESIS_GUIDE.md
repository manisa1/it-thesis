## Experimental Design

## 4 Conditions Testing 2 Factors:

| Condition | Noise Type | Solution | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|----------|---------|
| Static Baseline | None | No | DCCF under ideal conditions |
| Static Solution | None | Yes | Control: solution doesn't harm performance |
| Dynamic Baseline | Dynamic | No | DCCF's weakness under realistic noise |
| Dynamic Solution | Dynamic | Yes | Our solution's effectiveness |

## Key Parameters:
- Dynamic Noise: 30% exposure bias with ramp schedule
- Solution: Popularity-aware reweighting (Î±=0.5) + warm-up (10 epochs)
- Evaluation: Recall@20 and NDCG@20 metrics

## Expected Results

Your thesis will demonstrate:

1. DCCF Vulnerability: ~14% performance drop under dynamic noise
2. Solution Effectiveness: ~1-2% robustness improvement
3. No Static Harm: Minimal impact under ideal conditions
4. Thesis Contributions: Clear problem identification + practical solution

## How to Use for Your Thesis

## For Writing:
1. Problem Statement: Use dynamic vs static noise explanation
2. Methodology: Reference the modular code architecture
3. Results: Use generated tables and visualizations
4. Discussion: Leverage the automated insights analysis

## For Defense:
1. Code Quality: Show professional, well-documented implementation
2. Reproducibility: Demonstrate one-command experiment execution
3. Rigor: Point to comprehensive logging and error handling
4. Results: Present clear statistical analysis and visualizations
5. **Academic Standards**: Highlight use of established robustness metrics from literature

## For Lecturer Review:
- Professional Code: Modular, documented, type-hinted
- Clear Experiments: Configuration-driven with proper logging
- Comprehensive Results: Automated analysis with statistical insights
- **Academic Robustness Analysis**: 8 established metrics from peer-reviewed literature
- **Baseline Comparisons**: 4 state-of-the-art models for fair evaluation
- Easy Reproduction: One-command execution for verification

## Academic Robustness Analysis

### **ðŸ“Š Established Metrics Implementation**
Our robustness analysis follows **established academic standards** using 8 metrics from literature:

```bash
# Generate comprehensive academic robustness analysis
python run_comprehensive_robustness_analysis.py
```

**Output**: `runs/academic_robustness_analysis/`
- `academic_robustness_table.csv` - Main comparison table
- `academic_robustness_table.tex` - LaTeX format for thesis
- `detailed_robustness_metrics.csv` - All 8 metrics detailed
- `academic_robustness_heatmap.png` - Offset on Metrics visualization
- `academic_performance_drops.png` - Performance comparison

### **ðŸŽ¯ Key Academic Benefits**
- âœ… **No custom metrics** - All from established literature
- âœ… **Peer-reviewed sources** - Top-tier conferences (SIGIR, WWW, etc.)
- âœ… **Standard formulas** - Exact implementation from papers
- âœ… **Comprehensive coverage** - Multiple robustness aspects
- âœ… **Thesis-ready** - LaTeX tables and academic visualizations

## Running Experiments

## Option 1: Complete Automation (Recommended)
```bash
./run_thesis_experiments.sh
```

## Option 2: Step by Step
```bash
# Generate data
python make_data.py

# Run individual experiments
python run_experiment.py --config configs/experiments/static_baseline.yaml
python run_experiment.py --config configs/experiments/static_solution.yaml
python run_experiment.py --config configs/experiments/dynamic_baseline.yaml
python run_experiment.py --config configs/experiments/dynamic_solution.yaml

# Analyze results
python analyze_thesis_results.py
```

## Option 3: Quick Testing
```bash
python run_all_experiments.py --quick # Reduced epochs for testing
```

## Understanding Results

## Key Files Generated:
- `runs/summary.csv` - Main results table for thesis
- `runs/robustness.csv` - Robustness drop analysis
- `results/thesis_main_table.csv` - Formatted for thesis
- `results/thesis_results.png` - Visualization for thesis
- `results/thesis_insights.csv` - Statistical summary

## Interpreting Output:
- Lower robustness drop = better (our solution should show improvement)
- Minimal static impact = good (solution doesn't harm baseline)
- Positive dynamic improvement = success (solution works under noise)

## Customization

## Modify Experiments:
Edit files in `configs/experiments/` to change:
- Noise levels (`noise_level: 0.3`)
- Reweighting strength (`reweight_alpha: 0.5`)
- Training epochs (`epochs: 15`)
- Model parameters (`embedding_dim: 64`)

## Add New Experiments:
1. Create new config file in `configs/experiments/`
2. Run with: `python run_experiment.py --config your_config.yaml`

## Extend Analysis:
Modify `analyze_thesis_results.py` to add:
- Additional metrics
- Different visualizations
- Statistical tests
- Confidence intervals

## Performance Notes

- Runtime: ~10-15 minutes for all experiments
- Memory: ~2GB RAM recommended
- Storage: ~100MB for all results
- GPU: Optional (automatically detected)
