## Decision Framework

Based on the extracted information, we'll decide:

### Option A: Accurate Implementation
**If the method is simple enough:**
- Implement the exact algorithm
- Run experiments under same conditions
- Direct performance comparison

### Option B: Benchmark Comparison  
**If the method is too complex:**
- Use their published results
- Create benchmark comparison table
- Focus on positioning your contribution

### Option C: Simplified Adaptation
**If partially implementable:**
- Implement core principles
- Be transparent about simplifications
- Compare adapted version

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Paper Review**: Please read both PDFs and extract the information above
2. **Method Assessment**: I'll analyze implementability 
3. **Implementation Strategy**: Choose best approach (A, B, or C)
4. **Execution**: Implement or create benchmark comparison

## Quick Assessment Questions

To help decide the approach, please answer:

### For Paper 1 (Exposure-aware DRO):
1. Does it use complex mathematical optimization (minimax, dual problems)?
2. What's the core algorithmic contribution?
3. Do they provide clear algorithmic pseudocode?
4. What datasets do they test on?
5. What are their best Recall@20 and NDCG@20 results?

### For Paper 2 (PDIF):
1. Is it mainly a preprocessing/filtering approach?
2. Does it require complex personalization algorithms?
3. What's their denoising mechanism?
4. What datasets do they test on?
5. What are their best performance results?

## Implementation Priority

Based on your answers, we'll prioritize:
1. **Simpler method first** (likely PDIF)
2. **More complex method second** (likely DRO)
3. **Benchmark comparison** for any too-complex methods

## Academic Integrity Approach

Regardless of approach chosen:
- ✅ **Transparent methodology** description
- ✅ **Clear implementation scope** statement  
- ✅ **Honest comparison** framework
- ✅ **Proper attribution** to original authors

Please review the PDFs and provide the extracted information so we can proceed with the most appropriate implementation strategy!
